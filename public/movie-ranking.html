<h2>My Top 3</h2>
<hr>
<h3>1. 13 Hours in Bengali</h3>
<p style = "color:rgb(38, 0, 255);">This film had a beautiful storyline and the flashbacks to the soldier swimming in the ocean were carefully orchestrated and important for character development in the film.</p>
<h3>2. Everything Everything</h3>
<p style = "color:rgb(38, 0, 255);">I just loved how this story explored love. It was perfect for a teen demographic</p>
<h3>3. Acrimony</h3>
<p style = "color:rgb(38, 0, 255);">The scriptwriters really put their best foot forward when it comes to this series as it really does a great job at creating conflicting opinions as both characters in the film can be sympathised with. Which makes it intriguing and hard for the audience to decide who the antagonist is in the film.</p>
